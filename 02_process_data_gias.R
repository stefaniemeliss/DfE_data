#### Get Information about Schools ####
#######################################

# Get Information about Schools (GIAS) is the Department for Education’s register 
# for several organisation types and where information on other organisations is 
# recorded and maintained.

# GIAS is used by the department and key partners to contact establishments, 
# update systems, perform analysis and inform policy decisions, some of which 
# carry funding implications.

# Establishment, federation, academy trust and approved local authority users 
# can access their records by signing into their DfE Sign-in (DSI) account.

# ‘Get Information about Schools’ is a comprehensive database of educational establishments in England. 
# It contains data on around 65,000 establishments, including academies, maintained schools and children’s centres.

# Get Information about Schools currently contains over 250 data fields for each establishment, 
# and this number is expected to grow.

# **SEARCH**: This is a register of schools and colleges in England. 
# You can search for and download information on establishments, establishment groups 
# (such as a local authority, trust or federation) or governors. 
# Schools, local authorities and academy trusts can also update details by signing in to their DfE Sign-in account.

# **DOWNLOAD**: This data is updated daily. The data fields and the order of the data fields can change in these downloads. 

# The difference is Children's centre and Children's centre linked sites are not included in the all establishment data extract (DOWNLOAD) 
# but they will be included in the results (SEARCH) from the find an establishment search if they are not filtered out.
